/* QUe Link:https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/
 
 LOGIC::Start creating window. and while traversing check the character which has occured most and its count...now check the differnece between total element and that max_count...It means we have the difference the amnt of operation we need to do it make same as max_count wala elemnt..If diff > k then this winodow is not valid move element from left..if the left elemnt was the character which has the most elemnt then dec most elemment too.
